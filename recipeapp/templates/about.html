  <h2>About us</h2>
  <p>
    One sunny morning, as Godswill was strolling through his Neighbourhood in Lagos, Nigeria, he came across a middle-aged
    neigbour Joke, who appeared distraught. Concerned, as is his usual manner, Godswill approached Joke and kindly
    asked if everything was alright. Joke, with a heavy heart, explained that her husband had recently been diagnosed
    with diabetes, and they were struggling to find suitable meal options that could help him manage his condition.
    Inspired by Joke's story, Godswill realized there was a tremendous need for a resource that provided delicious
    meal ideas specifically tailored to individuals with diabetes. He knew that maintaining a balanced diet was crucial
    for managing the condition, and he felt compelled to help.
    
    Determined to make a difference, Godswill felt that creating a website dedicated to diabetic-friendly meals for the
    ALX portfolio project will be a perfect start. He shared this idea with Ijeoma his project partner who showed interest
    in his amazing vision. Together, they brainstormed ideas and poured their hearts into building a comprehensive platform
    called "Diabetics Meal Companion"
    
    Diabetics Meal Companion as the name implies, is designed to be a one-stop hub where people with diabetes could find a
    vast collection of mouthwatering recipes, expertly crafted by Us. The website incorporates various features including
    nutritional information, meal planning tools, and interactive forums where users could share their experiences and
    support one another.
    
    We know that catering to various dietary needs and taste preferences is essential. We ensured that our website offers
    a wide range of meal options, accommodating different African cuisines, dietary restrictions, and personal preferences.
    Every recipe was carefully crafted to strike a balance between taste and nutrition, using wholesome ingredients that
    are accessible to everyone.
    
    We hope that the success of Diabetics Meal Companion will in the nearest future, catch the attention of medical
    professionals and organizations specializing in diabetes care. We hope our website's potential to improve the 
    lives of millions around the world with diabetic-friendly diets will not only be recognised but also become a beacon
    of hope for anyone seeking guidance and inspiration on their diabetic journey.
